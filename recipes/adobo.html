        <h2>How to make Filipino Adobo</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Marinate the pork belly in soy sauce and crushed garlic.
                 It is best to marinate it overnight. If time is limited, 
                 one hour should be enough. Some like to add vinegar during the process. 
                 You may do so if preferred.</li>
            <li>Drain the marinade. Save it for later. The marinated pork needs to be browned. 
                Heat a cooking pot. Add pork with garlic. You can also add a few tablespoons of 
                cooking oil. Cook the pork until it turns brown.</li>
            <li>Cook the pork until tender. Do this by pouring the remaining marinade, if any. Also add water. Let the liquid boil. 
                This is the part where I put the whole peppercorn and dried bay leaves. These ingredients complete my pork adobo. Boiling 
                for 40 minutes should be enough to tenderize the pork. There are times when you have to cook longer.</li>
            <li>If you have not added the vinegar as part of the marinade, pour it into the pot and let it cook for 10 minutes. 
                Salt is an optional ingredient for this recipe. Use it only if you think it is needed.</li>
        </ol>
